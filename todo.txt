BattleClient.java
    -connect() method
    *Possibly more constuctor work

BattleDriver.java
    *main method needs some sort of changes (IDK yet)

ConnectionAgent.java
    *IMPLEMENT THREADING
    -isConnected() method {check for purpose}
    -close() method
    -run() method {includes threading I presume}

BattleServer.java
    *Constructor might need some work
    *Figure out wtf the 'current' field is for
    *Start the game when there are 2 or more ConnectionAgents
    -listen() method
    -broadcast() method
    -messageReceived() implementation
    -sourceClosed() implementation

BattleShipDriver.java, Game.java, Grid.java
    *No work to be done?

FINALLY:
    *Go through and and add javadocs to EVERYTHING (if methods are in more than one file, make sure the documentation matches)
    *Ensure packages & imports are nice and neat (preferably alphabetized)
    *Ensure minimal catch statements {no catch(Exception)}
    *Ensure game functionality with a few VMs
    *Remove System.exit(s) where necessary (sometimes you aren't supposed to crash server
    *Go back and check all "TODO" statements.
